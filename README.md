Analyzed unemployment trends in India using Python. Performed data cleaning, visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn), and extracted insights from real datasets.

# Unemployment Analysis in India – Internship Project

## 📌 Project Overview
This project was completed as part of my Data Science internship at **Oasis Infobyte**. The aim was to analyze and visualize unemployment trends in India using real-world data. It helps understand how unemployment rates vary across different states and time periods.

## 🏢 About Oasis Infobyte
**Oasis Infobyte** is a tech-focused company that provides virtual internships in domains like Web Development, Data Science, and Machine Learning. Their goal is to help students gain hands-on experience and build a strong portfolio through practical projects.

## 🔍 Problem Statement
Analyze unemployment data in India to:
- Understand trends over time
- Compare state-wise unemployment rates
- Identify areas with consistently high or low unemployment

## 📊 Workflow
1. **Data Collection**
   - Used a dataset from reliable sources (e.g., CMIE or Kaggle).

2. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Cleaned the dataset using **Pandas**.
   - Handled missing values and formatted dates.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Visualized trends using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**.
   - Created bar plots, line graphs, and heatmaps for comparison.

4. **Insights**
   - Identified high unemployment regions.
   - Observed seasonal and pandemic-related spikes in unemployment.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📁 Dataset
Unemployment data was sourced from public repositories like Kaggle or government portals.

## ✅ Outcome
Gained insights into India's unemployment scenario and improved skills in data analysis, visualization, and storytelling with Python.

## 🙌 Acknowledgment
Special thanks to **Oasis Infobyte** for the opportunity to learn and apply data science concepts through this valuable internship experience.
